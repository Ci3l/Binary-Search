Unfortunately for now I can't host the python code, but you can run it by clicking the link on *View Project* then you just have to enter your list with the item separated by commas in *Stdin Inputs*, pass a line and enter the item you want to know the index of (else I advise you to activate the interactive mode). If it doesn't work you can paste my code in this [compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/python3-programming-online/) and add your items in *Stdin Inputs* (separated by commas) pass a line and enter the item you're looking for.
